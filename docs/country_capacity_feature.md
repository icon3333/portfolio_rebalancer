# Country Investment Capacity Feature

## Overview

The Country Investment Capacity feature provides users with a visual representation of how much additional capital can be allocated to each country without breaching the global "Maximum % per Country" investment rule. This helps users make informed decisions when rebalancing their portfolios while maintaining proper geographic diversification.

**Enhanced Features (v2.0):**
- ðŸŽ¨ **Design Consistency**: Chart styling matches Portfolio Allocations table design
- ðŸ“Š **Detailed Hover Information**: Shows individual positions for each country
- ðŸ’… **Professional Styling**: Clean, modern appearance with proper color scheme
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes

## Location

The feature is located on the **Portfolio Allocation** page (`/allocate`) in the **Global Overview** tab, under the "Portfolio Allocations" section as an expandable card titled "Global Country Capacity".

## How It Works

### Data Sources
1. **Total Investable Capital**: Retrieved from the user's budget settings configured on the Allocation Builder page
2. **Maximum % per Country**: Retrieved from the user's global allocation rules (also from Allocation Builder)
3. **Current Country Investments**: Calculated by aggregating all user positions by country (using yfinance data or user overrides)

### Calculation Formula
For each country with existing positions:
```
Max Allowed Amount = Total Investable Capital Ã— (Maximum % per Country Ã· 100)
Remaining Capacity = Max(0, Max Allowed Amount - Currently Invested Amount)
```

### Chart Features
- **Type**: Horizontal bar chart styled to match Portfolio Allocations table
- **Sorting**: Countries sorted by remaining capacity (ascending - least to most)
- **Data Labels**: Shows remaining capacity in euros (â‚¬)
- **Enhanced Tooltips**: Display comprehensive information including:
  - Country name (header)
  - Remaining capacity (highlighted in primary color)
  - Currently invested amount
  - Maximum allowed amount
  - **Individual Position List**: Shows all positions in that country with:
    - Company name
    - Investment value
    - Portfolio association
- **Visual Design**: 
  - Primary app color (#00c4a7) for bars
  - Professional typography matching app fonts
  - Clean borders and spacing
  - Table-like styling for consistency
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Dynamic Height**: Chart height adjusts based on number of countries

#### Error Cases
- `401 Unauthorized`: User not authenticated
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Database or calculation errors

## Implementation Details

### Backend (`app/routes/portfolio_api.py`)
- `get_country_capacity_data()`: Main API function
- Fetches budget and rules from `expanded_state` table
- Aggregates position values by country from `companies`, `company_shares`, and `market_prices` tables
- Calculates remaining capacity with proper zero-clamping for over-allocated countries

### Frontend (`templates/pages/allocate.html` & `static/js/allocate.js`)
- Expandable card interface with toggle functionality
- Lazy loading: Data fetched only when expander is first opened
- Error handling for API failures and empty states
- ApexCharts integration for chart rendering

### Database Schema
The feature uses existing tables:
- `expanded_state`: Budget and rules configuration
- `companies`: Company data with optional country overrides
- `company_shares`: Position quantities
- `market_prices`: Current prices and yfinance country data

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No Budget Data**: Returns empty result with default 10% max per country
2. **Over-allocated Countries**: Remaining capacity clamped to 0 (no negative values)
3. **No Positions**: Shows informative message
4. **API Errors**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Missing Country Data**: Countries without data labeled as "Unknown"

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_country_capacity.py -v
```

Tests cover:
- Authentication validation
- Empty data scenarios
- Capacity calculation logic
- Sorting and data formatting

## User Experience

1. User navigates to Portfolio Allocation page
2. Clicks on "Global Country Capacity" expander
3. Chart loads automatically showing remaining investment capacity per country
4. User can hover over bars to see detailed breakdown
5. Countries with zero remaining capacity are clearly identified
6. Chart updates when budget/rules are modified (requires page refresh)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Real-time updates when budget settings change
- Color coding (green = high capacity, red = at limit)
- Export functionality for the chart data
- Integration with allocation suggestions
